People API
This project is a REST API developed in Go that retrieves and enriches information about people (name, surname, patronymic, age, gender, nationality) using external APIs and stores the enriched data in a PostgreSQL database. It also provides various API endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, and querying people.

Features
Fetch people information by ID.

Add new people with enriched data (age, gender, nationality).

Delete people records.

Pagination and filtering for listing people.

Swagger documentation for the API.

PostgreSQL database integration.

Logging for debugging and information purposes.

Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

Go (version 1.18 or higher)

PostgreSQL (for the database)

Swagger for API documentation generation

(Optional) golangci-lint for linting

3. Set up PostgreSQL
Make sure PostgreSQL is running and create a database.

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
# Connect to PostgreSQL
psql -U postgres
# Create the database
CREATE DATABASE people_db;
Ensure your .env file has the correct PostgreSQL connection details.

Example .env file:

ini
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres

–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
swag init -g cmd/main.go
Running the Project
To start the server, run:

bash
–ö–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
–†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ç–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å
